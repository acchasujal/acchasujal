# Hi, I'm Sujal Gupta

I’m a curious tech learner who enjoys building real-world web applications, exploring how systems work under the hood, and continuously improving my problem-solving skills.

I like working across the stack — from clean UI and frontend logic to backend APIs and data flow — and I learn best by building projects and breaking things along the way.
